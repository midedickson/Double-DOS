- 👋 Hi, I’m @Double-DOS
- 👀 I’m a Full Stack Developer with 3 years of experience in Python, Go, Javascript/Typescript
- I play around with Dart (Flutter), React, and NodeJS from time to time building small usable projects that I can put in the hands of users.
- You can find some of them and their progress here: https://midedickson.notion.site/c11d052f28554423899d49c1b3df25a8?v=767c2e1ddf9b491e95c2b4f312f06530
- 🌱 I am fascinated about helping businesses scale using software.
- I deeply believe that the adoption of software is more useful for businesses across all industries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANY PROJECT I CAN to further push this adoption.
